# DiscordBotOne
This is the tester AI bot for the discord server (DARK CITY)

Okay so:

To get this working:

1) Download all files
2) Open up Discord, just open it
3) Run "main.py" EXACTLY AS IT IS
4) Go back onto discord and you should see the bot online
5) Use it. You must start every command with "$ianua" (without the quotation marks)

NOTE: THE PROGRAM FILE MUST BE RUNNING ON SOMEONE'S PC, AND MUST BE UNTOUCHED FOR THE BOT TO WORK
      IF THE PROGRAM IS CLOSED, THE BOT WILL NOT WORK
      
I am trying to get it onto the server platform, hosted by Heroku. I spent 3 hours yesterday, but could not get past this final error.
! [remote rejected] master -> master (pre-receive hook declined)

I also apologise for the poor commenting, between the funeral and by bday, i haven't had / got much time to work on anything.

Enjoy
