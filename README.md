# DiscordBotOne
This is the tester AI bot for the discord server (DARK CITY)

Okay so:

To get this working:

1) Download all files
2) Open up Discord, just open it

3) Put all the files must be at the highest location. This means: When you click the main folder, the files should be at the top. You shouldn't have to go through any other files to get to it
4) Open the entire folder in an idea (e.g. open with VSCode). Do this otherwise it won't be able to find the "DiscordIntents file"

5) in the folder wherer everything is, you need to create a .env file. Call it ".env". If you look in the discord chat (AI Dev, you should see i have posted some strange thing like TOKEN = 358TBQIUTRGHU34T). Copy and paste that line into the ENV file but don't touch it.

6) Run "main.py" EXACTLY AS IT IS
7) Go back onto discord and you should see the bot online
8) Use it. You must start every command with "$ianua" (without the quotation marks)

If you see random new files being created, do not worry. That is expected.


NOTE: THE PROGRAM FILE MUST BE RUNNING ON SOMEONE'S PC, AND MUST BE UNTOUCHED FOR THE BOT TO WORK
      IF THE PROGRAM IS CLOSED, THE BOT WILL NOT WORK
      
I am trying to get it onto the server platform, hosted by Heroku. I spent 3 hours yesterday, but could not get past this final error.
! [remote rejected] master -> master (pre-receive hook declined)

I also apologise for the poor commenting, between the funeral and by bday, i haven't had / got much time to work on anything.

Enjoy
